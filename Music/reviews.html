<h1>The Nietzsche's Philosophy of Music </h1>
<p>Friedrich Nietzsche learned how to play the piano when he was just a child. Unlike most kids from 19th century German families, he was motivated not by pressure from his parents but his own interest in the artform. As with his philosophical hunches, this interest developed remarkably rapidly. By the time he was a teenager, Nietzsche was composing songs of his own.</p>
<p>Nietzsche's love for and understanding of music shaped his philosophy in more ways than one. It inspired his writing style, which was lyrical and poetic when compared to the dry and unimaginative language used by his predecessors. More importantly, music played an indispensable role in Nietzsche’s understanding of life — so much so that, according to him, one could not exist without the other. <cite>https://bigthink.com/high-culture/friedrich-nietzsche-music-philosophy/</cite></p>
