   <p><blockquote><cite><b>“What we’ve seen is that the digital market is very different from physical market,” </b>Michael Smith, professor of information technology and marketing at Heinz College and Tepper School of Business, said. “And when someone moves from physical market to digital market, they move across all platforms. Once they go digital, they don’t go back to DVD.”</cite></blockquote></p>
   <p>The decline in DVD sales can be attributed to several factors, including the rise of digital streaming platforms, changing consumer preferences, and advancements in technology. With the convenience of streaming services offering a vast library of content accessible at any time, many consumers have shifted away from purchasing physical DVDs. Additionally, the widespread availability of high-speed internet has made streaming more convenient and cost-effective than buying DVDs. Furthermore, the trend towards minimalism and decluttering has led to a preference for digital content over physical media. As a result, the demand for DVDs has steadily declined, marking a significant shift in the way people consume and collect entertainment.
